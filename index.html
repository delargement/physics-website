            A simple analogy
        </h2>

        <p class="my-8">
            Picture a billiard table, with two billiard balls, labeled A and B, set at the left two corners. If you simultaneously hit both balls at an angle towards the middle of the board, we would expect them to collide and rebound into the top two holes. A will go to the top right hole, while B will go to the bottom right. Nothing surprising here.

        <p class="my-8">
            In fact, once you know the initial position of the two balls and the angle and their initial velocity, you already know which ball will end up where. If someone asks, you could even describe their trajectories!

        <p class="my-8">
            This fact, which we often take for granted, is a feature of classical mechanics:

            The Heisenberg uncertainty principle suggests that the balls may head off at slightly different angles, or maybe one moves faster than the other. In whichever case, how do we know whether the balls collide, rebound and remain on the same side, or pass each other and switch sides? Well, we can't. And it isn't for lack of trying. Not the sharpest cue stick, or finest ruler can overcome the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

            Statevectors
        </h2>

        <p class="my-8">
            However, there is one way to know for sure, which is to reach into the billiard holes and check them for oneself. But up until then, we don’t know whether the system’s state is in (top = A, bottom = B) or (top = B, bottom = A). (for brevity, we’ll specify these states as \(\ket{AB}\) and \(\ket{BA}\) respectively, inspired by typical quantum physics notation). So how do we move forward?

            The trick is to describe the system probabilistically, using the framework statevectors. Suppose a system can take on any number of states \(\ket{i}\), each with probability \(|a_i|^2\) for some (complex) number \(a_i\). Then the system’s state can be written as the statevector \(\ket{\psi} = a_1 \ket{1} + a_2 \ket{2} + \ldots \). This encodes all the information of the system.
        </p>

        <p class="my-8">
            Back to the original problem, assuming that \(\ket{AB}\) and \(\ket{BA}\) are equally probable, there are two ways we can denote the system’s statevector.
        </p>

        <p class="my-8">
            First note that the statevector should have some symmetry between \( \ket{AB} \) and \( \ket{BA} \). Intuitively, \( \ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{AB} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{BA} \) would seem to do the job. But, \(\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{AB} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{BA} \) works just as well as we only care about square of the coefficients, i.e. \((-1)^2 = 1 \).

            Using the equation for fermions  \( \ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{AB} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{BA} \) observe that if we let \(A=B\), we get  \( \ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{AA} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{AA} =0\). This is also known as the Pauli's exclusion principle which states that two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state within a quantum system.

            In electrodynamics, we can use the idea of fermions and the tendency to avoid each other. Recall the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which says that two fermions cannot be in the same state. But what defines an electron’s state?
        </p>
         <p class="my-8">
             For electrons orbiting the nucleus, there are four numbers which ‘serialize’ an electron. We call them the <b>quantum numbers</b>.
        </p>

          <p class="my-8">
              The <b>principal quantum number (n)</b> states which electron shell the electron is in. However, the idea of that electrons orbit in circular orbits like how a satellite orbits around the earth is little misleading. You could say we are <i>uncertain</i> of the path of the orbiting electron. What we can say is there is a certain region around the nucleus where you are very likely to find the electron, and these regions can take interesting shapes.
        </p>

        <p class="my-8">
            The shape is characterized by the <b>magnetic quantum number (m)</b> and the orientation of the shape in space is characterized by the <b>angular quantum number (l).</b>
        </p>
        <p class="my-8">
            Finally, electrons possess an intrinsic ‘spin’ which can either be spin ‘up’ or ‘down’. A textbook description of spin is to liken the electron to a top which can be spinning either clockwise or anticlockwise about its own axis. This is unrelated to the electron’s rotation about the nucleus, as remember, spin is intrinsic to the electron, not its orbit.
        </p>
        <p class="my-8">
            However, an interesting feature of electrons is that they possess a certain ‘magnetic moment’. What this means is that an electron has a magnetic dipole, producing a magnetic field like a tiny bar magnet. And as it turns out, the polarity of this bar magnet is related to the spin of the electron. It seems that we have found a link between electron spin and magnetism.
        </p>
        <p class="my-8">
            Ferromagnetism is what allows materials like iron, cobalt, and nickel to become permanent magnets. But how does it work?
        </p>
        <p class="my-8">

            Within a ferromagnetic metal, chemistry class would tell you that the structure consists of large metallic ions and a sea of delocalized electrons.
            But as we learned, these electrons also act as tiny magnetic dipoles. Each individual electron doesn’t have a particularly strong magnetic field, but add up the field across the electron sea and you can obtain a strong ferromagnet.

        </p>
        <p class="my-8">

            This only works when ‘most’ of the magnetic dipoles are pointing in a single direction. Otherwise, there would be no net magnetic field as we zoom out.
        </p>
        <p class="my-8">
It would be quite hard to individually turn each magnetic dipole the right way around. However, we know from common experience that we can make a permanent magnet by just inducing an external magnetic field through it with an electromagnet.
        </p>
        <p class="my-8">

            This is because the magnetic dipoles tend to want to point in the same direction, because this is what minimizes the potential energy of the system.

        </p>

        <p class="my-8">

            This is due to two effects. First, electrons repel each other by coulomb repulsion, due to their like negative charges. Since repulsive forces have positive interaction energy, this increases the potential energy of the system. This is where Pauli’s exclusion principle comes in. When two magnetic dipoles are pointing the same direction, then they can’t come too close to each other, or we say that “they can’t occupy the same orbit”. But this isn’t the case when they have opposite orientation.

        </p>

         <p class="my-8">

             Thus, the Coulomb interaction energy is minimized when the dipoles point in the same direction. However, this tendency for a pair of dipoles to align themselves is only relevant when they are very close together, as that’s when Pauli’s Exclusion Principle comes into play. In summary, by nudging some the magnetic dipoles in a ferromagnetic material to point towards a particular direction, i.e. with an electromagnet, the rest of the magnetic dipoles will follow suit and remain pointing in that direction. You have just created a permanent magnet.

        </p>

        <p class="my-8">

           There is still one caveat. The magnetization process has some randomness, when temperature increases, the tendency for magnetic dipoles to randomly flip increases. This complicates things and makes it harder for the entire system to point in a particular direction.

        </p>


        <p class="my-8">

            It’s like how you will never find liquids don’t have ordered molecular structures like solids, because it is hard to keep the individual molecules in place. We can expand on this analogy, and ask: Is there a critical temperature, at which we can no longer magnetize a ferromagnet, like how a melting point distinguishes a solid and a liquid? If so, what is it?

        </p>


        <p class="my-8">

            There is, it’s called the <b>Curie Temperature.</b> And there is a hands-on way of finding the curie temperature with a simple simulation.

        </p>

        <p class="my-8">

            Recall the rules of magnetizing a ferromagnet.

        </p>

        <p class="my-8">
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    1.	A ferromagnet contains a bunch of electrons which behave like magnetic dipoles. Let’s pretend they form a neat square grid, and we will work in 2 dimensions.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
            2.	Magnetic dipoles like to align themselves with the external field.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                3.	Magnetic dipoles like to align themselves with magnetic dipoles next to them.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
4.	The greater the temperature, the greater of chance of the polarity randomly flipping.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        </p>

        <p class="my-8">
            Using these rules, we can play a game. Arrange a bunch of magnetic dipoles in an N-by-N square grid, representing them as a pixel that is either black or white, corresponding to the polarity of their magnetic moment/spin. Each pixel has a random chance to switch polarity, and this random chance is calculated based on the external magnetic field, polarity of the four neighbouring magnetic dipoles in the four orthogonal directions, and the temperature.
        </p>

            This is exactly the Ising model, and you can try playing around with our interactive simulation.
