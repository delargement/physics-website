            Picture a billiard table, with two billiard balls (we’ll label them A and B) placed at the bottom two corners. As you hit both balls towards the middle at the same time, they will rebound into the top two holes. A will go to the left, while B will go to the right. If someone then walks in, even though he didn’t see the collision, he would still know that the ball that that ends up on the left must be A and the one on the right must be B.

            I believe the answer is yes, but not for the reasons you may have heard. Many articles proffer expert testimony that Go is harder than chess, making this victory more impressive. Or they say that we didn’t expect computers to win at Go for another 10 years, so this is a bigger breakthrough. Some articles offer the (correct!) observation that there are more potential positions in Go than in chess, but they don’t explain why this should cause more difficulty for computers than for humans.
