            A simple analogy
        </h2>

        <p class="my-8">
            Picture a billiard table, with two billiard balls, labeled A and B, set at the left two corners. If you simultaneously hit both balls at an angle towards the middle of the board, we would expect them to collide and rebound into the top two holes. A will go to the top right hole, while B will go to the bottom right. Nothing surprising here.
        </p>
        <img alt="billiard table" src="public/billiard%201.svg" class="object-cover my-8">

        <p class="my-8">
            In fact, once you know the initial position of the two balls and the angle and their initial velocity, you already know which ball will end up where. If someone asks, you could even describe their trajectories!
        </p>
         <p class="my-8">
        This fact, which we often take for granted, is a feature of classical mechanics:
        </p>

        <div class="shadow-md">
            <p class="p-3 border">
                <b>(Classical)</b>
                The state of a physical system is specified by the positions and momenta of the particles, and this determines the rest of the system such as the trajectories.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="my-8">
However, this is where quantum mechanics diverges from classical mechanics. Definite trajectories of the particle violate the intrinsic uncertainty to the state of a physical system.
        </p>

        <img alt="billiard table" src="public/billiard%202.svg" class="object-cover">
        <p class="my-8">
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle suggests that the balls may head off at slightly different angles, or maybe one moves faster than the other. In whichever case, how do we know whether the balls collide, rebound and remain on the same side, or pass each other and switch sides? Well, we can't. And it isn't for lack of trying. Not the sharpest cue stick, or finest ruler can overcome the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

            Statevectors
        </h2>

        <p class="my-8">
            However, there is one way to know for sure, which is to reach into the billiard holes and check them for oneself. But up until then, we don’t know whether the system’s state is in (top = A, bottom = B) or (top = B, bottom = A). (for brevity, we’ll specify these states as \(\ket{AB}\) and \(\ket{BA}\) respectively, inspired by typical quantum physics notation). So how do we move forward?

        <p class="my-8">
The trick is to describe the system probabilistically, using the framework statevectors. Suppose a system can take on any number of states \(\ket{i}\), each with probability \(|a_i|^2\) for some (complex) number \(a_i\). Then the system’s state can be written as the statevector \(\ket{\psi} = a_1 \ket{1} + a_2 \ket{2} + \ldots \). This encodes all the information of the system.
        </p>

        <p class="my-8">
            Back to the original problem, assuming that \(\ket{AB}\) and \(\ket{BA}\) are equally probable, there are two ways we can denote the system’s statevector.
        </p>

        <p class="my-8">
            First note that the statevector should have some symmetry between \( \ket{AB} \) and \( \ket{BA} \). Intuitively, \( \ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{AB} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{BA} \) would seem to do the job. But, \(\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{AB} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{BA} \) works just as well as we only care about square of the coefficients, i.e. \((-1)^2 = 1 \).

            Properties of Bosons and Fermions
        </h2>

        <p class="my-8">
            We will now see how the sign of the statevector affects the properties of the system.
        </p>
        <p class="my-8">
            Using the equation for fermions  \( \ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{AB} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{BA} \) observe that if we let \(A=B\), we get  \( \ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{AA} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{AA} =0\). This is also known as the Pauli's exclusion principle which states that two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state within a quantum system.
            </p>
        <p class="my-8">
            On the other hand, for bosons we observe that \( \ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{AA} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{AA} \)  does not vanish, meaning there is no limit on the number of bosons that can be put in the same quantum state. In fact, you bosons tend to clump together, as compared to distinguishable quantum particles as we'll soon see.
        </p>

        <p class="my-8">
            To get a feel for the statistics of the particles, we can use simple combinatorics.
