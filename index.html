            A simple analogy
        </h2>

        <p class="my-8">
            Picture a billiard table, with two billiard balls, labeled A and B, set at the left two corners. If you simultaneously hit both balls at an angle towards the middle of the board, we would expect them to collide and rebound into the top two holes. A will go to the top right hole, while B will go to the bottom right. Nothing surprising here.
        </p>

        <p class="my-8">
            In fact, once you know the initial position of the two balls and the angle and their initial velocity, you already know which ball will end up where. If someone asks, you could even describe their trajectories!
        </p>
         <p class="my-8">
        This fact, which we take for granted, is a feature of classical mechanics:
        </p>

        <div class="shadow-md">
            <p class="p-3 border">
                <b>(Classical)</b>
                The state of a physical system is specified by the positions and momenta of the particles, and this determines the rest of the system such as the trajectories.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="my-8">
However, this is where quantum mechanics diverges from classical mechanics. Definite trajectories of the particle violate the intrinsic uncertainty to the state of a physical system.
        </p>
        <p class="my-8">
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle suggests that the balls may head off at slightly different angles, or maybe one moves faster than the other. In whichever case, how do we know whether the balls collide, rebound and remain on the same side, or pass each other and switch sides? Well, we can't. And it isn't for lack of trying. Not the sharpest cue stick, or finest ruler can overcome the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

        </h2>

        <p class="my-8">
            However, there is one way to know for sure, which is to reach into the right billiard holes and check for oneself. But up until then, we don’t know whether the system’s state is in (top = A, bottom = B) or (top = B, bottom = A). (for brevity, we’ll specify these states as |AB> and |BA> respectively, inspired by typical quantum physics notation).
